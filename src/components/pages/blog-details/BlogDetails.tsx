                                    Despite the many places you can visit in Spain for a once-in-a-lifetime cannabis experience, cannabis
                                    clubs, dispensaries, and cannabis museums are good options to consider. Though any location in this
                                    guide will offer incredible experiences, you'll never forget not all sites open their doors to the
                                    public as you would like them to due to the cannabis laws of the country. Cannabis clubs, however, are
                                    known for being private establishments that operate by an invite-only model. Therefore, how much effort
                                    you put into booking will make all the difference regarding access.
