These clubs cultivate marijuana exclusively for their registered members, rather than selling it openly to the public. In contrast, Amsterdam’s coffeeshops function as commercial establishments where anyone can purchase cannabis alongside food and drinks. To access cannabis in a Spanish club, members make a voluntary contribution rather than a direct purchase. Transactions follow a unique approach, using terms like 'acquire' or 'receive' instead of 'buy' or 'sell.' This donation-based system ensures compliance with legal regulations while providing members with a safe and controlled cannabis experience."
